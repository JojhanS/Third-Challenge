# Password Generator

## Description

I have created this site in order to allow someone to create a strong and safe password. Instead of relying on words and numbers, like 'apple1', this site will create a random password from 8-128 characters that will use lower,upper,numerical and special characters if the user desires. This will allow user to create stronger and safer passwords, as well as choose which characters are used in those passwords.

## Installation

The link to the website is here: https://jojhans.github.io/Third-challenge/
## Usage

Press "Generate Password" button and copy the given password.
